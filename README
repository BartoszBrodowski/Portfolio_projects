This is a github repository for projects that I want to include in my portfolio. 

There I store the projects I'm most proud of and that I want to show in my interviews.

At the moment the projects are:
1. Weather App (HTML, CSS (SASS), JS, OpenWeatherMapAPI)
2. Snake game (Python, pygame)
3. Sudoku (React, SASS, work in progress)
